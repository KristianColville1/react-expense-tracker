### React is all about "**Components**"

React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, and it is centered around the concept of components.

There are several reasons why React is built this way, with a focus on components:

1. **Modularity:** Components in React are self-contained units of UI that can be composed together to build complex user interfaces. This modular approach allows for better organization and separation of concerns in the codebase, making it easier to understand, maintain, and debug. Components can also be reused across different parts of an application or in different applications altogether, which promotes code reusability.
2. **Reusability:** React components are designed to be highly reusable. They can be created once and used in multiple places throughout an application, which helps to reduce duplication of code and promotes efficient development practices. This reusability can lead to more efficient and scalable codebases, as changes made to a component can be propagated across all instances of that component in the application.
3. **Abstraction of UI:** Components in React provide an abstraction layer for UI development. They encapsulate the UI logic and presentation details, making it easier to reason about the behavior and appearance of the user interface. This abstraction allows developers to focus on building the individual components without having to worry too much about the intricacies of the underlying DOM manipulation or UI rendering, which can be complex and error-prone.
4. **Separation of Concerns:** React promotes the separation of concerns, allowing developers to separate the UI logic from other application logic. By breaking down the user interface into small, self-contained components, each component can focus on a specific functionality or visual aspect, making it easier to understand and maintain. This separation of concerns also enables parallel development, where different team members can work on different components independently without stepping on each other's toes.
5. **Performance Optimization:** React's component-based architecture allows for efficient updates and rendering of the user interface. React uses a virtual DOM (a lightweight in-memory representation of the actual DOM) to optimize updates and minimize the number of actual DOM manipulations needed. When a component's state changes, React only updates the affected components and re-renders them, resulting in better performance compared to traditional UI frameworks that may re-render the entire UI tree.

Overall, React's component-based approach provides a structured and efficient way to build user interfaces, with benefits such as modularity, reusability, abstraction of UI, separation of concerns, and performance optimization. This is why React is often referred to as a library that revolves around components.

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
